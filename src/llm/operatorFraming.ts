// VENDORED MIRROR of src/llm/operatorFraming.ts — keep in sync with the
// webapp. The mcp-server is independently buildable (its own tsconfig,
// its own deps), so we vendor the framing block here rather than reaching
// across the repo boundary.
//
// Heuresis's smaller operator doctrines (ASIT ~500-800 tok, Branch ~600-1200
// tok) sit right around or below Sonnet's 1,024-token minimum-cacheable-size
// threshold. Below that floor the Anthropic API silently does NOT cache the
// prefix — `cache_creation_input_tokens` comes back as 0 and the next call
// re-tokenizes everything at full price.
//
// IMPORTANT: this block is the cache prefix for the ENTIRE MCP operator
// path. Editing it invalidates every operator's cache. Keep BYTE-IDENTICAL
// with the webapp copy at src/llm/operatorFraming.ts.

  '  • You return: ONE JSON object matching the requested schema. NEVER prose before or after, NEVER markdown fences, NEVER trailing commas, NEVER comments inside the JSON. The caller parses with strict-mode zod and rejects anything that does not match.',
  '  • If the schema asks for partitions[], emit between 3 and 5 top-level partitions unless the operator explicitly says otherwise (EXPLORE allows 4–8). Each partition is a STANDALONE concept title (2–5 words, ≤60 chars, no parent-prefix, no trailing period), a 1–2 sentence description, a ≤5-word partitionAttribute naming the distinguishing AXIS, a 1–3 sentence rationale citing the operator and any K used, and a kReferences[] of K-ids you actually used.',

C-K operators MUST treat C-nodes as undecidable noun-phrases (never solutions in disguise — verbs like "build", "add", "use", "implement", "create" at the start of a label belong in the parking lot, not in the C-tree).',
  '  • Be additive, not redundant. The <context> block (when present) lists existing canvas labels and sibling axes — do not propose paraphrases of either. Where possible, partition on an axis NOT yet present in <sibling_axes>.',
  '  • Be honest. Use the optional selfCritique field to surface the strongest assumption or risk in each partition. Do not flatter.',
