// Heuresis MCP — global fetch dispatcher wiring (proxy + IPv4 preference).
//
// Node 18-22's undici does NOT auto-honor HTTPS_PROXY / HTTP_PROXY (Node 24+
// does). Without this, every outbound fetch fails with "fetch failed" on
// networks that require an egress proxy — both the device-pairing + GoTrue
// refresh calls in the CLI and the SupabaseClient's PostgREST queries in the
// running MCP server. We install an undici ProxyAgent as the global dispatcher
// once, at process start.
//
// When NO proxy is set we STILL install a custom global dispatcher: an Agent
// that resolves hostnames IPv4-only. On networks with a dead / black-holed
// IPv6 DNS resolver (e.g. a stale ISP IPv6 nameserver handed out over DHCPv6),
// a default dual-stack getaddrinfo issues BOTH an A and a AAAA query and waits
// for both — the AAAA query stalls ~4-8s or times out against the dead resolver
// before the (instant) A answer can be used, so every fetch intermittently
// hangs even though IPv4 connectivity is perfectly fine. Forcing family:4 skips
// the AAAA query entirely. This is safe for this client: every endpoint it
// talks to (Supabase behind Cloudflare) is IPv4-reachable — in fact the
// Supabase host publishes no AAAA record at all.
//
// Idempotent across the whole process (module-level flag) and safe to call from
// every entry point.
//
// NOTE: this only covers `fetch` (PostgREST + auth). The Realtime websocket
// uses a separate transport that the global dispatcher does not touch.
